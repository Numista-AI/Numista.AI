[2026-01-10 16:29:09] AI:  The most valuable U.S. coin ever sold is the **1933 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle**.

A single specimen sold at a Sotheby's auction in June 2021 for **$18.9 million**.

### Why is it so valuable?

*   **Historical Context:** In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the U.S. off the gold standard to combat the Great Depression. He ordered all 1933 Double Eagles to be melted down before they ever entered circulation.
*   **Extreme Rarity:** A few coins escaped the U.S. Mint, making them illegal to own.
*   **Unique Legal Status:** The coin that sold for $18.9 million is the only 1933 Double Eagle that the U.S. government has ever deemed legal for a private individual to own, the result of a lengthy legal battle. This unique legal sanction makes it a one-of-a-kind collectible.

Other contenders for the most valuable U.S. coin include the **1794 Flowing Hair Silver Dollar**, which once held the record at over $10 million, and the **1804 Draped Bust Silver Dollar**, known as the "King of American Coins."
